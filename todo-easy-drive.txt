Jwt Expired issue is partially fixed. After token remove application statue is not updated. Like application component navbar, ReviewForm, and Dashboard state is not update after token is expired or removed.
Solution1: Use redux store for logged in status like persist store for user info and token status
[11:47 AM 2/3/2025 - Done] - use window.location.reload() in axios interceptor to reload the page after token is expired. It partially solved the problem. But it is not a good solution. It will not update state of other tab state.

Step2: if so then logout user - logout is user is not implemented yet

Done - Axios need to properly setup. Axios is not properly setup for both sending token headers or getting responses

Done - Step2: Get correct response from axios and show response result

       Like there is two different way to send data using 'body' property redux way or 'data' property axios way see what to use. Currently I in favor for 'body' way
[Solution] - In axiosInstance for error or response send directly without any modification. 
              And problem with 'body' and 'data' conflict solve by in axiosBaseQuery use 'body' property to receive input for POST and set 'data' property value to 'body' property
